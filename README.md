# Analytical Study for Automobile Re-Seller
## IIT Madras – Business Data Management Capstone Project

## Project Overview
This repository contains the complete Business Data Management (BDM) capstone project submitted as part of the IIT Madras Online BS Degree Program in Data Science. The project focuses on performing a structured analytical study of a real-world pre-owned automobile dealership to enable data-driven decision-making.

The study was conducted on **New My Choice Cars**, a pre-owned automobile dealership operating in Pimpri, Pune, which relies primarily on manual transaction recording methods. The absence of digital data systems limited operational insights related to inventory management, pricing strategy, and sales performance.

This project digitizes, structures, and analyzes transaction data to identify operational patterns and propose a sustainable data management framework for business optimization.

## Organization Background
New My Choice Cars is a pre-owned automobile reseller operating in Pimpri, Pune. The dealership functions in both B2C and C2B modes, purchasing vehicles from individuals and reselling them to customers.

Business operations were previously dependent on physical agreement documents (“Kararnama”) without structured digital record-keeping. This restricted visibility into profitability, inventory turnover, and customer demand trends.

---

## Problem Statement
The project addresses multiple operational challenges:

- Manual record-keeping preventing performance tracking
- Lack of structured inventory data
- Difficulty in analyzing sales trends
- Pricing decisions based on intuition rather than data
- Limited visibility into customer purchasing patterns
- Inefficient procurement and inventory decisions

---

## Methodology
The project followed a structured analytical workflow:

### Data Collection
Primary transaction data was collected directly from dealership records.

### Data Digitization
Manual records were converted into structured spreadsheet datasets.

### Data Cleaning
Inconsistent entries, missing values, and formatting issues were standardized.

### Feature Structuring
Derived variables such as month, day of week, vehicle category, and price bands were created to enable business-level analysis.

### Analytical Techniques
Analyses performed include:

- Monthly sales performance trends
- Weekly business cycle analysis
- Vehicle category demand analysis
- Price band segmentation
- Payment mode analysis
- Revenue distribution studies
- Geographic customer distribution

## Key Findings
Major insights include:

- Sales activity follows seasonal patterns with identifiable peak months.
- Weekend transactions dominate business closures.
- SUVs represent the highest demand vehicle segment.
- Premium and luxury segments generate majority revenue.
- Loan and bank transfers dominate payment modes.
- Budget vehicles show limited demand.
- Inventory procurement aligned with demand improves turnover efficiency.
